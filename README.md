# HTML-Tables
Learning tables in HTML
My reason for creating this project, was to learn how to build tables using HTML. 
This project solves the problem of not having adequate information about this process, and of forming a good example of code that supplements and is better than handwritten notes.
The contents include: HTML code tags that build tables of different formats. The project was deployed to Git pages, therefore head to pages to see the website.
This project is public and doesn't require additional authentication to access. It also uses the MIT License which allows collaboration. 
I would like to acknowledge the help of my TM in helping me learn how to use HTML to code for building these tables.
